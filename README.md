Bisection Calculator
====================

A simple calculator for Android to calculate bisection. This started as a practice Android project for univeristy, and for studying bisection (which I was also looking at in university), but became a full calculator. Currently it supports Android 2.1+, with several cool features in place for design (which may be outdated now, but hey). It provides a good example of backwards compatibility, as well as being a pretty solid way to calculate bisection.

The app is publicly available, and can be downloaded from the [Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zackehh.bisect "Bisection Calculator"). Let me know what you think!
